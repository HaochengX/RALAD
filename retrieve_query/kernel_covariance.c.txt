You are now given some HLS pragma insertion assistants
assistant 1: K(n) = K = √ (3.24)

and
K = lim K(n) ≈ 0.6072529350088812561694 (3.25)

The scaling factors for different iterations can be calculated in advance and stored in a table. If we
always perform a fixed number of rotations, this is simply one constant. This correction could also
be made in advance by scaling v appropriately before performing the rotations. Sometimes it is
0
ok to ignore this scaling, which results in a processing gain

At each iteration, we need to know the angle θ of the rotation that was just performed. This
i
is derived as θ = arctan2−i. We can precompute these values for each value of i and store them in
i
an on-chip memory and use them as a lookup table. Additionally, we have a control decision that
determines whether the rotation is clockwise or counterclockwise, i.e., we must determine if σ is 1, assistant 2: void spmv(int rowPtr[NUM ROWS+1], int columnIndex[NNZ],
DTYPE values[NNZ], DTYPE y[SIZE], DTYPE x[SIZE])
{
L1: for (int i = 0; i < NUM ROWS; i++) {
DTYPE y0 = 0;
L2: for (int k = rowPtr[i]; k < rowPtr[i+1]; k++) {
#pragma HLS unroll factor=8
#pragma HLS pipeline
y0 += values[k] ∗ x[columnIndex[k]];
}
y[i] = y0;
}
}
Figure 6.2: The baseline code for sparse matrix vector (SpMV) multiplication, which performs the
operation y = M·x. The variables rowPtr, columnIndex, and values hold M in CRS format. The
first for loop iterates across the rows while the second nested for loop iterates across the columns
of M by multiplying each non-zero element by the corresponding element in the vector x which
results in one element in the resulting vector y.
Given a 2-dimensional array representing a matrix, write the C code to convert the matrix
to CRS form. Write the corresponding C code to convert the matrix in CRS form back to a
2-dimensional array., assistant 3: for (i = N − 1; i > 0; i−−) {
shift reg[i] = shift reg[i − 1];
}
shift reg[0] = x;

 Now try your best to Optimize the following code through inserting pragma hls lines

void kernel_covariance(int m,int n,float float_n,float data[100][80],float cov[80][80],float mean[80])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  int k;
{
    
    
    
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      mean[j] = 0.0;
      
      for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        mean[j] += data[i][j];
      }
      mean[j] /= float_n;
    }
    
    
    
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      
      for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
        data[i][j] -= mean[j];
      }
    }
    
    
    
    for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
      
      for (j = i; j < 80; j++) {
        cov[i][j] = 0.0;
        
        for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
          cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
        }
        cov[i][j] /= float_n - 1.0;
        cov[j][i] = cov[i][j];
      }
    }
