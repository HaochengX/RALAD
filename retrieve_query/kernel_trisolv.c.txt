You are now given some HLS pragma insertion assistants
assistant 1: for (i = N − 1; i > 0; i−−) {
shift reg[i] = shift reg[i − 1];
}
shift reg[0] = x;
acc = 0;

and

The scaling factors for different iterations can be calculated in advance and stored in a table. If we
always perform a fixed number of rotations, this is simply one constant. This correction could also
be made in advance by scaling v appropriately before performing the rotations. Sometimes it is
0
ok to ignore this scaling, which results in a processing gain

At each iteration, we need to know the angle θ of the rotation that was just performed. This
i
is derived as θ = arctan2−i. We can precompute these values for each value of i and store them in
i
an on-chip memory and use them as a lookup table. Additionally, we have a control decision that
determines whether the rotation is clockwise or counterclockwise, i.e., we must determine if σ is 1, assistant 3: int i;
acc = 0;

 Now try your best to Optimize the following code through inserting pragma hls lines
void kernel_trisolv(int n,float L[120][120],float x[120],float b[120])
{
  int i;
  int j;
{
    
    
    
    for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
      x[i] = b[i];
      for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        x[i] -= L[i][j] * x[j];
      }
      x[i] = x[i] / L[i][i];
    }
  }
